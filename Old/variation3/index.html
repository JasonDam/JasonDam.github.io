            Variation 3: A static map of Calgary which displays all the LRT stations in Calgary as well as every community in Calgary.
            The communities which are surrounding the stations are filled with a saturation of red. The saturation of the community corresponds to the
            crime count of the community according to the legend. Although this is a static visualization, the LRT station "Marlborough"
            is selected to allow viewers to know the names of the stations. The names of the communities are hidden as the data focuses
            on the area of the station instead of the community. Although the geographic position of the stations are accurate, many
            stations that are close together are hard to distinguish, like the downtown ones.
